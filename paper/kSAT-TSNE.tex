\begin{abstract}
We study the solutions of two random boolean satisfiability problems 3-SAT and XORSAT using recently developed machine learning techniques. We use non-linear embedding techniques to learn the local manifolds in which the solutions organize. In particular we provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first visualizing of the so-called clustering transitions that are known to occur in those problems. Finally, using unsupervised clustering methods we are able to automatically extract quantities such as the entropy of clusters.

\section{Introduction}
Machine learning is finding more and more applications in the context of physics \cite{2018arXiv180308823M}.
Chris Moore discussion, etc. cite Mézard, stat. phys. and glassy phases have been discussed in

\section{Model studied}
\emph{$p$-spin model}---. We consider the diluted $p$-spin model with $p=3$, defined as:
\begin{equation}
H=-\sum_{\langle ijk \rangle}^{\alpha N} J_{ijk} s_i s_j s_k, \label{pspin}
\end{equation}
where $J_{ijk}$ take value $+1$ or $-1$. An instance of the diluted $p$-spin model is obtained by choosing $\alpha N$ such couplings uniformly at random. The zero-temperature limit of the $p$-spin model
is equivalent to the $p$-XORSAT problem from computer science. The $p$-XORSAT corresponds to a linear system of equations in base 2 of the form $A\vec{x}=\vec{y}$ obtained from the mapping $s_i=(-1)^{x_i},~J_{ijk}=(-1)^{y_{ijk}}$, where $A$ is a sparse $N\times M$ matrix encoding the interactions with the $M$ constraints $\vec{y}$. As such, the problem of determining wether a XORSAT formula is satisfiable or equivalently
if the $p$-spin model possesses a non-frustrated ground-state Eq.\eqref{pspin} can be solved efficiently using Gaussian elimination which scales like $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$. The statistical properties of XORSAT have been studied using powerful methods from spin-glass physics \cite{mezard2003two}. We sampled the XORSAT solutions uniformly at random using Gaussian elimination. The results are presented in figure \ref{t-SNE}.

\subsection{Method used}
\paragraph{Uniform XORSAT sampler}


\paragraph{3-SAT sampler}
Here we rely on prior work by Zecchina et al. and sophisticated implementation of decimation based survey propagation algorithm. In order to decorrelate samples as much as
possible we perform trivial isomorphism of the CNF by a permutation of the litteral's labels. However we have no theoretical guarantees that the samples obtained are uniformly
distributed in the space of 3-SAT solutions. We hope that we at least capture the clusters with the largest entropy.

\subsection{Density clustering}

\subsection{Results and Discussion}
Spin glass models such as the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model or the Anderson model are known to be NP-complete \cite{venturelli2015quantum}. Consequently it is believed that no algorithm can be devised in order to compute the ground-state in a time scaling polynomially with the system's size. Much work has been made in trying understanding what makes a problem hard from a statistical mechanics point of view. In particular, in random satisfiability problems such $k$-SAT and XORSAT the onset of a glass transition has been associated with the appearance of frozen variables and clustering in the solution space, which has been conjectured to induce failure of local search algorithms \cite{moore2011nature}. Note that glassiness does not necessarily imply hardness to solve. Phenomenologically, it appears that for glassy problems, any local search/stochastic method will fail, i.e. finding the ground-state is exponential in the system size. However, if one is able to devise some global method based on non-local updates, then some glassy problems are known to be in $P$. This is the case for instance of XORSAT, which is equivalent to solving a linear system mod 2, and thus it can be solved efficiently using gaussian elimination \cite{ricci2010being}.

Along with this work we provide simple python packages for the $3$-SAT sampler (wrapper) and the XORSAT sampler along with a density clustering code, all of which are available at the author's GitHub.

%State preparation plays a quintessential role in present-day studies of quantum physics. The ability to reliably manipulate and control quantum states has proven crucial to many physical systems, from the quantum mechanical emulators ultracold atoms~\cite{bason_12,vanfrank_16,wigley_16} and trapped ions~\cite{islam_11,senko_15,jurcevic_14}, through solid-state systems like superconducting qubits~\cite{barends_16}, to nitrogen vacancy centres~\cite{zhou_17}. The non-equilibrium character of quantum state manipulation makes it a difficult and not well-understood problem of ever increasing importance to building a large-scale quantum computer~\cite{nielsen}.
%
%Analytically, state preparation has been studied using both Adiabatic Perturbation Theory~\cite{kolodrubetz_16} and Shortcuts to Adiabaticity~\cite{demirplak_03,delcampo_13,jarzynski_13,sels_16}. Unfortunately, these theories have limited application in non-integrable many-body systems, for which no exact closed-form expressions can be obtained. This motivates the development of efficient numerical algorithms, such as GRAPE~\cite{glaser_98, grape_05}, CRAB~\cite{caneva_11}, and Machine Learning~\cite{judson_92,chen_14,chen_14_ML,bukov_17RL,yang_17,dunjko_17,august_18,foesel_18,sorensen_18,zhang2018automatic}. The objective in Optimal Control theory is to find the set of controls that extremize a cost function, e.g.~ determine the optimal fidelity to prepare a target state, subject to physical and dynamical constraints. However, cost functions, usually defined on a high-dimensional space, are typically non-convex, and therefore there exist no algorithm guaranteed to find the optimal (global) solution in \emph{general}. Moreover, optimality does not automatically imply stability and robustness of the solution, which are required for experimental applications. Establishing the general limitations and constraints of quantum control is crucial for guiding the field forward.
%%Therefore, a fresh perspective on this old conundrum would be appreciated.  ?? ok maybe more enthusiasm here !

%\emph{Model studied and methods.---}Consider quantum spin-$1/2$ degrees of freedom $S^\mu_j$ described by the Ising model with a time-dependent transverse-field (c.f. Fig \ref{fig:schematic}.a): % defined by the Hamiltonian
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:H}
%H(t) = -\sum_j JS^z_{j+1}S^z_j + g S^z_j + h(t)S^x_j,
%\end{equation}
%with interaction strength $J\!=\!1$ (sets the energy scale), and an external magnetic field of a static $z$-component $g\!=\!1$ and a bounded time-varying $x$-component $\vert h(t)\vert\!\leq\! 4$. The presence of the longitudinal $z$-field renders the model non-integrable at any fixed time $t$, with no known closed-form expression for the exact instantaneous eigenstates and eigenenergies. We work in a non-perturbative regime with all couplings of similar magnitude.
